\section{Work Experience}
\textbf{Software Engineering Intern, Google Inc.}, Boulder, USA \hfill Jun. 2018 - Sep. 2016 \par
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HD Mapfacts Diff}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The goal of the project was to detect wrongly labeled building polygons in Geo team's Mapfacts database with up-to-date aerial image. Trained the semantic segmentation model, deeplabV3+, using high-quality labels and designed a heuristic algorithm comparing model predictions and human labels to detect potential wrong labels.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Research Experience}
\textbf{Machine Learning Research Assistant, Academia Sinica}, Taipei, Taiwan \hfill Aug. 2015 - July 2016 \par
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lightweight Discourse CNN Model for Sentiment Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed a new CNN model incorporating the knowledge of discourse rules (e.g contrast and concession) and the learning ability of the deep neural network.
        \item Performed experiments on several well-known sentiment analysis datasets (e.g. Stanford Sentiment Tree-bank) showing the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed model.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sensing Emotions in Text Messages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supervised on the project aiming to build a system that automatically conveys the emotion of received text to enrich the context in computer mediated communications.
        \item Built sentiment classifiers from LiveJournal posts with pre-trained word embedding as features.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Augmented NTUSD}: Built a Chinese sentiment dictionary containing polarity information of words for use of research on sentiment analysis. Designed experiments to test the applicability of the dictionary.
\end{itemize}

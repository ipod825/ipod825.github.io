\section{Research Experience}
\faMapMarker~\textbf{Academia Sinica}, Research Assistant \hfill Aug. 2015 - July 2016 \par
\textbf{Lightweight Discourse CNN Model for Sentiment Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed a new CNN model incorporating the knowledge of discourse rules (e.g contrast and concession) and the learning ability of the deep neural network.
    \item Performed experiments on several well-known sentiment analysis datasets (e.g. Stanford Sentiment Tree-bank) showing the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed model.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Sensing Emotions in Text Messages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervised on the project aiming to build a system that automatically conveys the emotion of received text to enrich the context in computer mediated communications.
    \item Built sentiment classifiers from \href{http://www.livejournal.com/}{LiveJournal} posts with pre-trained word embedding as features. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Augmented NTUSD}: Built a Chinese sentiment dictionary containing polarity information of words for use of research on sentiment analysis. Designed experiments to test the applicability of the dictionary.

\textbf{Thesis}: Investigation on Optimal Mixing with Linkage Sets and Its Application \\
\textbf{LTGA Improvement}: Analyzed on a theoretical basis how the linkage-tee genetic algorithm (LTGA) utilizes its linkage model and improved LTGA by applying a dynamic model throughout the optimizing process. \\
\textbf{GA Benchmark Design}: Analyzed on a theoretical basis what problems are difficult for genetic algorithms (GA-hard) and designed a benchmark with controllable problem complexity for testing modern GAs.
